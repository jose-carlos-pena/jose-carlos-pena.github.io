Untitled(Print of Two People Next to Each Other), 2020
Sound of a blurry image, Dimensions of a Print, Silicone Mold of a Precious Moment

           Pictured two people out of focus holding each other, in a close intimate dance with one another. The one on the left wearing a tan rimmed hat, oversized, and a patterned coat, that bleeds into the background. The one on the right is wearing a purple hat that gently borders the head, and a bright white shirt. The background is too blurry, the potential of a row of empty chairs sitting against the wall is possible. The chairs don't match existing in multiple different variations. 
My mom talked about the photo the one not blurred, is from a party where she dressed in drag as a man. She is the one pictured, in the image. 
I've only seen the one that is blurry.
